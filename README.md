My project: Math Snake.
Test your mental agility and reflexes in this unique game that blends fast-paced snake action with challenging arithmetic! You'll need sharp focus and quick thinking to solve math expressions in your head while skillfully guiding your snake to collect the correct numbers. Be careful not to grab the wrong ones or run out of boundsâ€”each mistake could cost you the game! Perfect for players who enjoy both brain-teasing puzzles and exciting gameplay.
